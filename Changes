----------------------
1.3.0 |-> rewriting the module so that it will return $TRUE, which will equal 1, because that is supposed to be the default 'true' in perl, or something like that.  Oh, and I plan to make it readonly using the readonly module that I found out about on a mailing list.  :)

----------------------
Forked er... I mean, I split the modules up by what they do. --> 0.01 |-> True.pm, False.pm, and Donothing.pm. 

12/12/12 - 06:44:07 pm
----------------------
True.pm - 0.02 |-> fixed the module package name from TestValuz to Test, which is what I want it to be. 

12/12/12 - 06:46:25 pm 
----------------------
True.pm - 0.03 |-> added another layer to the testing just to make sure that $TRUE will eval to true.    

12/12/12 - 07:04:10 pm
----------------------
Tools.pm - 0.03.4 (major.(minor)(revision).(beta)(alpha)) |-> merged all modules back again.
